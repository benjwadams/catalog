The IOOS Catalog
=======

A web based catalog of IOOS services and datasets, available at http://catalog.ioos.us

The Catalog obtains all service URLs from the metadata managed via [IOOS Service Registry](http://github.com/ioos/registry) and accessed through the [ESRI Geoportal Server hosted by NGDC](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geoportal/).  See the [registry](http://github.com/ioos/registry) documentation for instructions for getting dataset metadata into the Service Registry.
