A dataset is some form of data produced by a service. Gridded data, point data, and observation data are just some of the datasets harvested from a service. A single service may produce one or more datasets.  Datasets also contain summary variable and attribute information collected at the time the dataset is harvested.  From this attribute and variable information, a compliance score is generated based upon how well the dataset adheres to the IOOS Asset Inventory version 1.0 specifications.
